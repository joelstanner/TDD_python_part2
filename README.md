# Test Driven Development with Python

## Code derived from the book

This is my second time through this book. The first time I did not know much
python at all. I'm re-reading and re-coding the project to fill in the holes
of knowledge that I just skipped over last time.

I suspect it will be a much more comprehensive exercise for me this time.
